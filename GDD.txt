Plot:
    Player starts at broken teleport / shuttle thing. There is a checkpoint scanner, that they can use, and
    after that move on to outside world. Player has almost zero health.

    There are alien scientist enemies, that will try to capture player, and raving hound enemies that
    try to eat both aliens and player. Player can outrun aliens, and outsmart hounds.

    Player must wander around to find tracks to another checkpoint port, after what will be final climax thing.
    Tracks can be footprints of another human adventurer. Checkpoint machine can have specific number of slots,
    used by those other.

    Player has no means of fighting at the beginning, and will at most find a gun with 3 or so bullets.

    Around the play arena there are hidden hp boxes, that player can find. These can maybe be checkpoints too.
    Also the other checkpoint thing in the end is unpowered and player needs to find powercells.
